# FILENAME:  puppet-postrun
# AUTHOR:    Bennett Samowich <bennett.samowich@nasa.gov>
# DATE:      2011-04-26
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#  This script is intended to run via puppet and the postrun_command option.
#
#  This script grabs the syslog messages for the puppet run logged with the
#  PPID of this script.  If the syslog messages do not contain "(noop)$"
#  then they are written to the OUTFILE.  The OUTFILE can then be used by
#  an external monitoring system such as Nagios to alert when a puppet run 
#  fails.
#
# USAGE:
#  * Copy this script to /usr/local/bin
#  * Add the following line to the [main] section in puppet.conf
#    postrun_command=/usr/local/bin/puppet-postrun
#  * Create a puppet recipe to touch OUTFILE, or echo DATE into it,  on
#    every run.  This will ensure that we can distinguish between live and
#    noop invocations of puppet.
