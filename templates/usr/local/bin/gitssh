#
# This is a ssh wrapper for Git that automatically detects whether a
# per-repository SSH key has been defined, and if so, passes it as an
# argument to ssh.  It is useful where an SSH agent is impractical and
# .ssh/config isn't working (e.g. in some root sudo environments)
#
# It will also run ssh at LogLevel=Error, suppressing banner text with
# or without a key.
#
# To set up a repository for use with this, run:
#   git config ssh.key <path_to_key>
# e.g.
#   git config ssh.key ~/.ssh/id_rsa-gitproject
#
# A different key can be specified for each repository.  If no key is
# specified, this wrapper will still fall through to a straight ssh
# call.
#
# After that is done, if this script is in the path, run:
#   export GIT_SSH=gitssh
#
# If it is not in the path, specify the full path to gitssh.
#
