#
# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
# The "nullok" option allows users to change an empty password, else
# empty passwords are treated as locked accounts.
#
# The "sha512" option enables salted SHA512 passwords.  Without this option,
# the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases used the option "md5".
#
# The "obscure" option replaces the old `OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in
# login.defs.
#
# See the pam_unix manpage for other options.

<% if @cracklib -%>
# Support NPR2810.1 requirements
# Note: type is set to null to stop cracklib from referring to all
#       passwords as UNIX passwords.  This is necessary to prohibit
#       confusion between changing LDAP and UNIX passwords.  Instead
#       cracklib will simply ask for "New password" & "Confirm password"
